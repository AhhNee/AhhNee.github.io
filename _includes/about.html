                    <p class="large text-muted">Originally from the far north of Germany, I came to Berlin to study Interface Design 
                    at the FH Potsdam, and began working at Service Design agency Fjord in 2011. As a Designer I am responsible for creating 
                    innovative services, products and strategies for clients from varying industries from all around the globe.
					I think of my job much like solving a puzzle, in that I must find simple solutions for complex problems, guide 
					teams through every stage of the design process, balance user and business needs, and make sure that all these pieces 
					come together in services with an outstanding user experience.<br>
					<br>
					Apart from my design work, I spent as much time as possible on the outside with my two children, exploring nature 
					and playgrounds in and around Berlin. I am fascinated by graphic novels, and use their style of visual storytelling as an 
					inspiration on my designs. I keep a clear head through meditation, and by riding my bike on a daily basis.</p>
