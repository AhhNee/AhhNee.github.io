                    innovative services, products and strategies for clients from varying industries from all around the globe.<br>
					<br>
					I tackle problems and figure out how to solve them by using service design methods.<br>
					This way I ensure that I gain as many insights as possible in order to shape my workflow and start translating 
					insights into ideas. For communicating these ideas, I heavily rely on rapid prototyping to make every phase and 
					iteration of a project as tangible as possible.</p>
